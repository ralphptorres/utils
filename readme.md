# ralphs utils

This is a collection of small cli utils, automation scripts, and configured
binaries for my unix systems (darwin, linux).

Here's a quick rundown of each util and its purpose. 

- adjuster: allows adjustment of backlight, keyboard bkl, volume in/out via cli,
  and reports changes via notification. latter includes battery level
- jquery: queries various info eg. currently playing music, etc., and outputs
  them as json
- screenshotter: takes full/partial screenshot, then copies/saves and displays
  it thru notification
- yquery: queries various info eg. music lyrics and metadata, outdated packages,
  weather, etc., and outputs them in a format suitable for yambar
